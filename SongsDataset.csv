Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins.

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins.

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins.

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns

Once a cure
Now's a scar
Hold me not
Give me back my mind
My thoughts that you've taken
Starve me to care
Could the night help me shut you out?
You gave me a lesson
Not to go and dive
But i already dive
I will try to latch myself out of your space
Far away
Untill the distance passed its line
Its a new journey, my heart has had enough of pain
Once a fool
Now i'm awake
Hold me not
Give me back my mind
My thoughts that you've taken
Starve me to care
Could the night help me shut you out?

And we are in your way so you just gotta leave now
And we just need to understand your reasons
And you are gonna justify this treason
By telling me the promises that we sworn ain't enough

So now you gonna be another person?
And how do I explain this shit to our son?
How'd you tell a toddler about a girlfriend?
Daddy's gone

Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

You sit there with your phone in your hands and you're hurt
You tell me that you feel like you lost me when he came
I'm sorry but I cannot connect with your words
'Cause right now what matters isn't yours but it is his name
And we just need to find another income
'Cause she wants you to help her with her own one
And you want me to tell me that what you've done is okay

So now you gonna be another father?
And I will be a different kind of mother?
And how do you tell a toddler 'bout step brothers?
Daddy's strayed

Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there when he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone

Let's talk about family
Let's talk of the ties and the lies
And the love that we had in this family
Let's talk about honesty
You know nothing about honesty
Let go of your hands and our plans
And the chance that we had with this family

Well, I will be the strongest that he ever knew

Didn't know I was lost

But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young

Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"
1301184305,9,Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home"""

Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
But please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock and roll band
Who'll throw it all away
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed

Down to Gorky Park

An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
Can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past, forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change
The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away

That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me

But without you, I give up
I can't sing a love song

Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time
That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines
And I will love you, baby, always

In the cold November rain

Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away

I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, whoa-whoa

Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the west coast
Or will I die in the cold
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo
I hope you get your ball room floor

I wish I'd known that less is more

Drying up in conversation

All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high

The careless whispers of a good friend

Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I wish that we could lose this crowd

We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever

Who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall

The wine was bled
And there you led me on

Until the day was gone

And all that I've wronged

And then throw it all away
Oh I throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round

Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back
The way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away
The way you do

Elise believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke
And the make-believe ran out...

1301184220,4,Michael Buble,Fever,"Never know how much I love you, never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever - when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever - in the the morning, fever all through the night.
Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever - when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
Fever - in the the morning, fever all through the night.

Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago.
Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said ""Julie baby you're my flame""
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth.
Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him, she said ""Daddy-O don't you dare""
Give me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right.

Now you've listened to my story, here's the point I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever, be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn
Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn.
What a lovely way to burn."

It's not like I'm in love
But you know what I mean
'Cause she knows why I'm in
Money comes and goes
But lover stay
She knows all about how the world could go down
If we ever fall in love and more
She knows I could never be like how she needed
But I don't mind
Forever, I would try
Although she'd say no then go
Again and again and again, and to that I'd say
Hey, okay
Money comes and goes
But lover stay
Hey, okay

Waitin' for my favorite songs

And not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again
Just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well.Every Sha-la-la-la
Every Wo-o-wo-o
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine.When they get to the part
Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before
It's yesterday once more.Lookin' back on how it was
In years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed.It was songs of love that
I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
Still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away.Every Sha-la-la-la
Every Wo-o-wo-o
Still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing's
So fine.All my best memories
Come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry.
Just like before
It's yesterday once more."

Where you asked me for my name
The bookstore where we spent
5 hours hiding from the rain

Except I steal back all of my property
And leave you on the ground

With a girl on your arm but I won't let that keep me from this town

Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart (Yeah)
We were gonna move to Brooklyn, you were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool to remind us who we are

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and
Getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right, but
I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown, but I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids, but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by, but
These people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain,
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine""
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said ""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device""
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax, "" said the night man,
""We are programmed to receive.
You can check-out any time you like,
But you can never leave! ""

Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside
Bring me to life"

So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says, beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything
What's a little bit of hunger?
I could go a little while longer, she fades away
She don't see her perfect
She don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Oh-oh, oh-oh
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
No better you than the you that you are
(No better you than the you that you are)
No better life than the life we're living
(No better life than the life we're living)
No better time for your shine, you're a star
(No better time for your shine, you're a star)
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful"

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance

Please take me away from here
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
Please take me away from here
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (they said farewell)

If my dreams get real bizarre

All alone with the ceiling

I could spend my whole life getting over you

Kicking balls at my feet

There's a pile of my clothes
At the end of your bed

1301180161,1,YOASOBI,Monster (English Version),"Ah, so what a scene, let’s do another toast to confine
Match a city, overflowing laughing voices are
Pretended fabrications of a lie, blinded eye, deception
I’m trying not to go mad
Could a, could an aroma come and feed the brain in tune
With stimulation, reawaken inclinations
Don’t know who’s gonna go there today, I wonder
If I kept trying then, what can I, that cannot be done
On to the world, what can I, that cannot be done
Looking in those dark little eyes, I decide
I need to not once let your tear fall beneath
Get out to find it now, don’t ever let go
The brighter future knows to reach it
Even when the world is caught and full of wrong
Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once
No, I cannot be hurting no one
I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now
Woken to resume my need to stay the real me
So what a scene, here’s to another safely passed time
Masking every new bad rumor flowing in the city
Feel the lie, feel the lie, release to turn a blind eye
Choking on their own hysteria
Marching with an innocence, they proceed
To a location echoing the sound of feet skipping and
Feeling high, feeling high, memories of a lasting flavor
The other side’s insanity
Can you call the “standard good” a living at all
And can “nobody feeling sadder” be a living at all
How is a straighter path you could see a living at all
So let’s imagine going “no mistake” as living at all
And I don’t wanna live as you’d assume, be saying it’s right
And artificially be living and you’re saying it’s right
I don’t know what I’ll be, and to believe this, I wonder
Want to know the truth, what I’m inside and under
Oh, spill me the tale
Oh, spill me the tale
Still, we reside inside a dry confusing big world
I make a wish alone
Believe it, I just wanna be with you forever
Give me hope to be just smiling with you again
The skipping beating in my heart
Is shaking me within, and begins to shout
“Now you got to move, go make the way”
I will rise to prove the fragile little “myself”
Go bite into my own and reach it
Even when the world is caught, and full of wrong
Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once
No, I cannot see nobody cry
I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now
Woken to resume my need to stay the real me
I’m gonna keep ya from danger, there are too many
I’m running, I’m running, I’m running for you
I will overcome what is residing for you"

Far away or by the road
Waiting for the one
To find the way back home
Rain falls a thousand times
No footprints of come-and-go
You who once went by
Where will you belong?

In the last blow of wind
Not yet for the story on the last page

'Til I reach your arms
A madder there for you
Up against the stream
Waterways will join as one
Tracing to the source
No more strayed or lost
You will see petals fly
When lament becomes carol
Could you please hear my voice
That hungers for a duo?

Mm, I'm not
I spend my weekends tryna get you off
My mind again, but I can't make it stop
I'm tryna pretend I'm good, but you can tell

1301208530,3,Olivia Rodrigo,Happier,"We broke up a month ago
Your friends aren't mine, you know, I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was attached
For all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy, but not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind, she probably gives you butterflies
I hope you're happy, but not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I hope you're happy, just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier"

Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had
At night, when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh-oh
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh
At night, when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh-oh

It tears me up when you turn me down
I'm begging please, just stick around
I'm sorry, don't leave me, I want you here with me

To think about you in that way, but
I would be lyin'
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But I won't deny that
In the midst of the crowds
In the shapes in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you
Boy, you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me
Do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me
Do you feel the love?
And I could say I never unzipped
Those blue Levi's inside my head
But that's far from the truth
Don't know what's come over me
It seems like yesterday when I said
""We'll be friends forever""
Constellations of stars
Murals on city walls
I don't see nobody but you
You're my vice, you're my muse
You're a nineteenth floor view
I don't see nobody but you

Someone needs to come and pinch me now
I just can't believe what I have found
Standing here by me
Giving me the greatest gift you can
Saying yes and now our life begin
Choosing you daily

I knew that we can be
Together forever
Night we spent so long
Until you're asleep

Been waiting

Riding high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, but you warned me then
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end
So, any time I bleed, you let me go
Yeah, any time I feed, you get me know
Any time I seek, you let me know

And put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out, darling
I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
An empty shell
I used to be
The shadow of my life was hanging over me
A broken man
That I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul
What we doing? What we chasing?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture telling where we could be at
Like a heart ain't attached the way it should
You can give it away, you had, and you took the pay
But I keep walking on
Keep opening doors
Keep hoping for
That the call is yours
Keep calls on hold
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm begging
Mmm, ye-e-e-ah
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on
I can't fall back
I'm just a calm 'bout to fade to black
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you

A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick"", you heard them say it

She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it

To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, Amen, Amen, Amen

I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you
Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you
I don't wanna let go
I know I'm not that strong
I just wanna hear you
Saying, ""Baby, let's go home""
Let's go home
Yeah, I just wanna take you home

Come back, I still need you"

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd let my walls come down?
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know, you know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather

And what you compromise, I almost die, I doubt the water is red as mine
Ay, how you lonely in a room with God?
Never slow up, not even a pit stop
Praying my niggas'll never get caught
Overcame it all, like I'm some big shot
Was taught to be a man, up to the wrist watch
To the collar shirt tucked, with the front pocket
Part of adolescence when they go blossom
When your stars align, I hope there's no comet
So far it's...

I can see the planets from my window sill, and I tend to tell what is honest
I don't wanna fight no one, no contest
I just wanna undress my conscience
I just met a killer that's bent in his ways
Try to raise a family with minimum wage, what can I say?
Besides the demons, it's reality for the people that we love
And we are the ones that will team up and tee off the party
Dead end the school, but they'll show up real tardy
The audience awfully ready and rowdy
I meant it if I said it, you get in writing
Got into a science, but write with the lightning
Like soil, I'm grounded, the seed has just sprouted

And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an OK guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly it ran away
But it came back with a story to say
Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slope
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow
So for a while things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws"

And I don't wanna fight my king
I held you when you was weak
You caught me on my knees
Don't pressure me for some kids
And I won't pressure you for marriage
I know it's never the right time
But we gotta do things on our time
Sometime I still doubt myself
But at least now I love myself
And I am quite emotional
That's why you can't get close at all
So I start to push away
The ones that love me
'Cause I'm scared that they might walk away
I'm not perfect
So I try everyday and I grow a little bit
Read a little more so I can educate my kids
Eat for my soul and cleanse my spirit
Pray 'cause I'm ready for the bloom of the seed
Peace and serenity is all that I need
Sometimes we fall in love
Love is always in us
Sometimes we fall in love
Love is always in us
Sometimes we fall in love
Love is always in us

How did he learn to hold fruit in his hands?
And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
He had to leave though I begged him to stay

Fell to my knees and I wept for my life

He had to leave though I begged him to stay

Begged him to stay in my cold wooden grip
Begged him to stay by the light of this ship
Me fighting him, fighting light, fighting dawn
And the waves came and stole him and took him to war

He wrote
I'm broke
Please send for me
But I'm broken too
And spoken for

There is nothing to save

Show us the money
A smoke show picturesque affair
It started as all things do
A simple hello turned to romantic visions
Far away
They were too clever

As they sunk into each other's heart

Where our whole lives collide
The stars themselves fell
Like we did that night
Though it felt like the universe knew
Like a pack of friends who couldn't hold their laughter
They chose to be painfully obvious in front of us
Slightly unaware or in denial of the dangers ahead
We thrust our weary hearts into each other's arms
Content and comfortable
For years to come
They felt it right and true
Blessings and kisses
As they thought it was the universe's wishes
And though they could feel it then
It's not how they want to end
So they turn their heads away
As if they were to say goodbye

Let them know that I'm glad to go

For in death, I'm caressin' you
With the last breath of my soul

In flames of death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness is falling down
And the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter
Falls around the world tonight
Fightin' hard, fightin' on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The skeletors souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest wings in hell's domain
We watch the lands become
In fire and flame, and once again we know
So now we're flying we're free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness
Our quest carries on
Far beyond the sun down, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
So far away we wait for the day
For the light source so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and flames we carry on
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands
To the heavens above
Who descend unto their lies
Running back through the mid morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from the time in the foreign land
To a light beyond the stars
In your blackest dreams see to the need, that destiny is tied
And endlessly we're roaming free tonight
And on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on
So far away we wait for the day
For the light source so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and flames we carry on
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard, now can we understand
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man
So far away we wait for the day
For the light source so wasted and gone

Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause
I can't fight it anymore.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me it happens all the time.
It's a quarter after one.
I'm all alone and I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now.
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door.
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me it happens all the time.
It's a quarter after one.
I'm a little drunk and I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now.
Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.

But I'm a little drunk and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without

 For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
 By making his world a little colder.
 Hey Jude, don't let me down.
 You have found her, now go and get her.
 Remember to let her into your heart,
 Then you can start to make it better.
 So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
 You're waiting for someone to perform with.
 And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
 The movement you need is on your shoulder.
 Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
 Take a sad song and make it better.
 Remember to let her under your skin,
 Then you'll begin to make it
 Better better better better better better, oh.

How did we end up this way
What did we do wrong?
God
Even though the days go on
So far, so far away from
It seems so close
Always weighing on my shoulder
A time like no other
It all changed on that day
Sadness and so much pain
You can touch the sorrow here
I don't know what to blame
I just watch and watch again
Even though the days go on
So far, so far away from
It seems so close
Even though the days go on
So far, so far away from
It seems so close
What did it leave behind?
What did it take from us and wash away?
It may be long
But with our hearts, start a new
And keep it up and not give up
With our heads held high
You have seen hell and made it back again
How to forget?
We can't forget
The lives that were lost along the way
And then you realize that wherever you go
There you are
Time won't stop
So we keep moving on
Yesterday's night turns to light
Tomorrow's night returns to light
Be the light
Always weighing on my shoulder
A time like no other
It all changed on that day
Sadness and so much pain
Anyone can close their eyes
Pretend that nothing is wrong
Open your eyes
And look for light
What did it leave behind?
What did it take from us and wash away?
It may be long
But with our hearts start a new
And keep it up and not give up
With our heads held high
You have seen hell and made it back again
How to forget?
We can't forget
The lives that were lost along the way
And then you realize that wherever you go
There you are
Time won't stop
So we keep moving on
Yesterday's night turns to light
Tomorrow's night returns to light
Be the light
Some days just pass by and
Some days are unforgettable
We can't choose the reason why
But we can choose what to do from the day after
So with that hope, with that determination
Let's make tomorrow a brighter and better day

1301180154,2,YOASOBI,Into The Night,"Seize a move, you're on me, falling, and we were dissolving
You and me, skies above and wide, it brings on the true night on me
All I could feel was a ""Goodbye""
Those only words you wrote, it's plenty to understand ya
The sun is going down, the sky behind and visions of you would stand
Overlapping with you and the fence beyond
Remember the night that we met up
Broke into me and taken everything left in my heart
So fragile is that air, it always keeps on revolving near and wide
Loneliness envelops deep in your eyes
It's stuck in ""Tick-and-tocking"" mode
Never refraining shamble, block of sound
Too many terrible noises around
And the voice ringing in me gets louder
With tears about to fall
I need to find me an average happy tiptoe
Locating, never tough when I'm with you
Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights keep beating
I'm going to you, and giving brighter shiny tomorrows
What can ""Night"" for you mean, infinite? You could run with me
Place your hand in mine, you gotta stay, hold up
Want to leave it behind, dark cruel days, in deep, you may have hid before
I'm embracing you until more heat dissolve what is caught up
Sun will soon rise up into a day you're no more too afraid
Keep all of me in you
Only perceiving through your eyes
I see nothing, I'll soon hate you, keep me out, I'm crying out
You're falling into deeper fascination, giving away your love
That expression has got me crying out
She's gonna try to me, she's gonna lie
Got to force a belief and trust to keep on
Every time it happens, heap of attack, and now I'm back in
I got to cry, then who knows?
So we gotta keep on
If you gotta keep on
Then we're gonna keep on
One day, we will understand, I'm believing in you
""No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking""
As I show my needs, I reach to get back on, still not fit in
You free my hand, then leave it
""No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking""
Never told you the truth, I'm feeling that inside
Back for another ""Tick-and-tocking"" mode
Never refraining shamble, block of sound
Killing, oh, too many words that I gathered around
Won't let me go to your mind
""I want it to be done"" is what went out
It found a way to finally leak out of me
And for once, I could make you let out a smile
Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights are keeping me down
My new images of you, now, appear heavenly now
What can ""Night"" for you mean when fallen seas of tears are gone
They dissolve into the peace inside of you
Calling to life, hit beneath, crying days in the eternal
Give me what I saw in you, oh, what an end to stop all
Seize a move, you're on me, falling and we were dissolving
See me to it, fog is leaving, bright air move
Want to leave it behind, tucked all days away, forget, and hid beneath
Hand in hand, extend to me, that let me know beyond falls
Through the seas of beyond, so loud and blows you afloat in the sky
New wind moving into you
Tonight, don't ever lose sight of me and let go
You and me are running through the night in dark, I'll take you"

Without no seams nor needle work
(Bedclothes the child of the mountain)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(A sprinkling of leaves)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strands
(And polishes a gun)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
(Blazing in scarlet battalions)
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
(A cause they've long ago forgotten)

Let's make a plan to meet somewhere that is
Most far from ""goodbye""

Skimming through the days of old

At an unprecedented speed, I will
Dive right into you

And when I dozed off into a lukewarm can of soda, I
Dreamed of a world so far from here that's not on the map
Searching outside of the classroom window
Or in a summer morning that's brought from the commuting train

Words like ""tomorrow"" or ""future"" or ""fate""
No matter how far they extend their hands
We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
In a timeless land that is far out of reach

How I hope to have forever to spend

""How do you do""s and all the ""Nice to meet you""s
And breathe over a thousand-year cycle in a single day

I saw through my kaleidoscope
On a monotonous August morn'

When you appeared in front of me
You acted shy but I didn't miss your grinning face like
If it's the textbook of this world
Of how to make your smile on your face

I've been looking for ""incredible""s, the meaning of ""unbelievable""
I even hope for tragedies if it goes with the thrill
But when you were standing in front of my door
With every piece in your hand that I could ask for

Words like ""tomorrow"" or ""future"" or ""fate""
No matter how far they extend their hands
Let's breathe, and dream, we'll play together in this place
What do you say?

Even the way that you loved
I swear I could smell the scent of yours
And in the way that you walked
I could hear that bright laughter of yours

Since one day you will disappear
I'll keep every part of you
Make sure that it's burned into the back of my eyes
It's not a right that I'm due
My duty that is must have been kept

Words like ""tomorrow"" or ""future"" or ""fate""
No matter how far they extend their hands
We breathe, we dream, we raise our love

Has made it here before the rest has

Forgotten now, are rolling 'round the corners of the floor

Someday, I'll trade them all for just the very one

Girl that I have seen in school, that never have told ""hello""

But if when you're not around in this crazy world
Would be like the month of August without summer break
And if you're not around in this great world
Would be like Santa Claus without any glee

No, never mind what I said now
'Cause I'm on my way to you

Oh, we are time fliers
Dashing up the steps of time now
No more playing hide and seek with you and time
And always coming just short

You're quite a showy crier
Want to stop your tears, see your eyes drier
But when I went to wipe your tears dry
You refused but I saw them pouring down your face, I knew why

Smiling even when I'm feeling lonely

To stake my claim on your heart tonight

1301180154,8,RADWIMPS,Is There Still Anything That Love Can Do? ,"Born with nothing in my hands
I stumbled upon this place
Falling through a crack in time
I was writhing in pain
When those who make it in this age
Are only those who learn how to take
And everyone is giving up
Where do we all take a breath?

Governors and gods alike
Try to turn the other cheek
But even if you look away
The truth is always facing you
Courage and the strength of hope
The magical bond we share
We grow up only to forget
How we ever used them here
But same as you were on that day
I see you still standing there
Glowing in your innocence
You were always standing there
When the world turns its back on you
You find a way to stand and fight
Ready to face it all
I see you here, shining bright

[Chorus]
I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?

You are the one who found
My courage and I knew
I wanna pay it back to spend it all on you
You gave me love, we share
It's all because of you
You are the reason
Let me share this love with you

I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?

[Verse 3]
What if our destiny
Was just a roll of the dice
Or if it's up to the Gods?
And if they feel like playing nice
A mission that we didn't choose
Like armor that we can't remove
Or maybe it's a distant wish?
Something that we can't refuse
Prayers that are never heard
Reunions that never occur
Arguments that never clear
Hate that doesn't disappear
I hear the voices that forgive
I see them standing hand in hand
But with its arm open wide
The earth embraces all again

I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?

You are the one who found
My courage and I knew
I wanna pay it back to spend it all on you
This love we raised together
Shaped by me and you
You are the reason
Let me live this love with you

[Chorus]
I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?

So insignificant just you and me
So why were we given this dream?
And if this life is just going to end
Tell me, why are we allowed to feel hope?
And if it's just gonna slip out of my hands
Then why even give it to me?
'Cause ain't it sad how we try to hold on
Knowing one day, it'll be gone
Or maybe it's beautiful?
Answer me!

All these love songs we hear
Already, they've been sung to death
All the movies that we've seen
They said everything they can

Fell into this wilderness
But still, I need to know
I need to know
If there's still anything that love can do?
I need to know
If there's still anything that I can do?"

Waiting is waisting for people like me

All true love needs is a chance

You too like I

You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough
We were so close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me, the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every peace of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
We keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes were never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
You can fit me
Inside the necklace you bought
When you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me (hold me)
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"

Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Oh, oh, oh""

I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regrets

To say what we want
Use what we got

Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep

And all the things that I know
That your parents don't

Nowhere like I do

Nowhere like I do

Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep

What would you do?

Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?

Look deep inside
Deliver a true confession
What are you willing to live for?
Consider this question
Open your eyes
Examine your own reflection
What are you willing to die for?
When your backs' against the wall
And the times uncertain
Consider this question
No standing by
When flesh and blood are threatened
What are you willing to kill for?
We seek to understand
We cry with hand in hand
The bridges we build to connect
The distance that makes us forget
Hate dividing us, love reminding us
Of our shared humanity
Hope can be a shadow fleeting
I would rather die believing
Capture it all in a final act of faith
We seek to understand
We cry with hand in hand
A story that needs to be told
An answer that begs to found
The beauty we wish to behold
Is never too far away
Mothers for their children
Husbands for their wives
Martyrs for the kingdom
Fighting for your life
A soldier for his country
A junkie for the high
Teachers for their students
Vengeance for a crime
Rebels for their freedom
A tyrant for the prize
Courage for salvation
Money, love, and fame
Noble embrace
Lay down our lives for the cause
Death over shame
Grace before glory
To really feel the joy in life
You must suffer through the pain
When you surrender to the light
You can face the darkest days
If you open up your eyes
And you put your trust in love
On those cold and endless nights
You will never be alone
Passion glows within your heart
Like a furnace burning bright
Until you struggle through the dark
You'll never know the joy in life"

Blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine
You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon

Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light

Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch, you hung up on

I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It's only getting better if we want it to
You know that I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way, we'd never close our eyes, our eyes, never
It's so hard to think this could fade away
But what goes up must come down
Why can't we just live life with no consequence?
And always live in the now
Forget about the sunrise
Fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you

1301183322,1,Billie Eilish,Getting Older,"I'm getting older, I think I'm aging well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doing this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waiting at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest, I was still being ignored
(Lying for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged
Things I once enjoyed (ah-ah)
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
I'm getting older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm getting better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given (not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) to be abused, mmm
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for, mmh
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

Ooh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time
I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
By hurting you"

All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be
And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you
All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go
And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted

You may think you see
Who I really am
But you'll never know me
Every day
It's as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
I am now
In a world where I
Have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow
I will show the world
What's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection
Someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
There's a heart that must be free to fly
That burns with a need to know the reason why
Why must we all conceal
What we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?
I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?"

Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
The special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile

Whenever they try
To shut me or cut me down
I won't be silenced

Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless
Written in stone
Every rule, every word
Centuries old and unbending
Stay in your place
Better seen and not heard
But now that story is ending
'Cause I
I cannot start to crumble
So come on and try
Try to shut me and cut me down
I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
Speechless
Let the storm in
I cannot be broken
No, I won't live unspoken
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless
Try to lock me in this cage
I won't just lay me down and die
I will take these broken wings
And watch me burn across the sky
Hear the echoes saying I
Won't be silenced
Though you want to see me tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
Speechless
'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me

 And where I'd love to be, oh yeah
 Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
 To hold her when I'm not around

 And now I wish I'd stayed
 'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
 I'm missing you again oh no
 Once again
 There's nothing here for me on this barren road
 There's no one here while the city sleeps
 And all the shops are closed
 Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
 Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah
 Dear God the only thing I ask of you is to hold her when I'm not around

 I gave in, to selfish ways

 Never shamed but never free
 A life to heal the broken heart with all that it could
 Lived a life so endlessly
 Saw beyond what others see
 I tried to heal your broken heart with all that I could
 Will you stay?
 Will you stay away forever?
 How do I live without the ones I love?
 Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
 Place and time always on my mind
 I have so much to say but you're so far away
 Plans of what our futures hold
 Foolish lies of growing old
 It seems we're so invincible
 The truth is so cold
 A final song, a last request
 A perfect chapter laid to rest
 Now and then I try to find
 A place in my mind
 Where you can stay
 You can stay away forever
 How do I live without the ones I love?
 Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
 Place and time always on my mind
 I have so much to say but you're so far away
 Sleep tight, I'm not afraid (not afraid)

 Lay away a place for me (place for me)

 To live eternally

 But it's so hard to stay
 When I have so much to say and you're so far away
 I love you, you were ready
 The pain is strong and urges rise
 But I'll see you, when He lets me
 Your pain is gone, your hands untied

 I'll endure the exile
 The darkness of night falls around my soul
 And the hunter within loses control
 Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
 Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
 This demon inside has ahold of me
 Clenching its power, trying to break free
 Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
 Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
 Move fast baby, don't be slow
 Step aside, reload, time to go
 I can't seem to control
 All this rage that's inside me
 Pullin' shots, aimin' dots, yeah, I don't miss
 Branded by fire, born in the abyss
 Red hot temper, I just can't resist
 All this vengeance inside me
 All of these thoughts runnin' through my head
 Arm on fire, veins burnin' red
 Frustration is gettin' bigger
 Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
 Embrace the darkness that's within me
 No hiding in the shadows anymore
 When this wickedness consumes me
 Nothing can save you and there's no way out
 I'm a wildfire you won't tame
 Igniting my temper, can't put out my flame
 There's no way to contain
 This storm swelling inside me
 I'm a bomb you can't defuse
 Might just accept you're gonna lose
 Can't turn down, I refuse
 To hold back anymore
 All of these voices inside of my head
 Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
 Frustration is getting bigger
 Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger
 When the night ends, it's not over
 We fight through to get closer
 Like a silver bullet piercing through
 I throw myself into you
 All of these voices inside of my head
 Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
 Frustration is getting bigger
 Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger"
1301184089,8,Victor Borba,Bury The Light,"You asked for them, so here they are: the lyrics to Vergil’s theme “Bury the Light” in Devil May Cry 5 by Casey Edwards and Victor Borba!
 
 Immortal temptation
 Takes over my mind
 Condemned
 Falling weak on my knees
 Summon the strength
 Of Mayhem
 
 I am the storm that is approaching
 Provoking
 Black clouds in isolation
 I am reclaimer of my name
 Born in flames
 I have been blessed
 My family crest is a demon of death
 
 Forsakened I am awakened
 A phoenix’s ash in dark divine
 Descending misery
 Destiny chasing time
 
 Inherit the nightmare
 Surrounded by fate
 Can’t run away
 Keep walking the line
 Between the light
 Led astray
 
 Through vacant halls I won’t surrender
 The truth revealed in eyes of ember
 We fight through fire and ice forever
 Two souls once lost and now they remember
 
 I am the storm that is approaching
 Provoking
 Black clouds in isolation
 I am reclaimer of my name
 Born in flames
 I have been blessed
 My family crest is a demon of death
 
 Forsakened I am awakened
 A phoenix’s ash in dark divine
 Descending misery
 Destiny chasing time
 Disappear into the night
 Lost shadows left behind
 Obsession’s pulling me
 Fading I’ve come to take what’s mine
 
 Lurking in the shadows under veil of night
 Constellations of blood pirouette
 Dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet
 Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
 A derelict of dark summoned from the ashes
 The puppet master congregates all the masses
 Pulling strings twisting minds as blades hit
 You want this power then come try and take it
 
 Beyond the tree
 Fire burns
 Secret love
 Bloodline yearns
 Dark minds embrace
 Crimson Joy
 Does your dim heart
 Heal or Destroy?
 
 Bury the light deep within
 Cast aside there’s no coming home
 We’re burning chaos in the wind
 Drifting in the ocean all alone"

 Most be the way I grew when I feel overwhelmed.
 Made a wrong turn, and I got burned.
 Every decision weighing on me in my world.
 So I just try to breathe, and I will try to see,
 All of the reasons we are where we're meant to be.
 I know I lost the race, backfired in my face,
 But I will find my way– eventually.

 The regret in my head got me taken over!
 Oo-oh!
 I'm alive and surprised, and it makes me wonder,
 Oo-oh!
 If you say everything that you learned this life,
 Makes you wise– I'm doing it, doing it right!
 Made enemies; they don't scare me.
 'Cause I got everyone I need here on my team.
 And we will fight; we're meant to thrive,
 In any circumstance you throw us in tonight.
 Inside of my mind, I been searchin', for the words that will cure all my hurtin'.
 Tough love got me feelin' deservin', rip back the curtain, that's how I'm learnin'.
 Reflect on the mess I created, respect for the deaths I hated,
 Making all the winning decisions without precision– not that I'd listen.

 The regret in my head got me taken over!
 Oo-oh!
 I'm alive and surprised, and it makes me wonder,
 Oo-oh!
 If you say everything that you learned this life,
 Makes you wise– I'm doing it, doing it right!
 Need the best, that the stress I've been holding.
 I'm the one, only one – I've been chosen,
 Tell the sorrow there's always tomorrow, always tomorrow, for another go.
 Recognize that I'm built like a champion,
 Realize that I'm here, and I'm standin',
 And my story is only starting, now that I'm parting, heading for stardom.
 Gonna give my all!
 If I ever fall, you better believe,
 I'm getting, I'm getting back up!

And telling it might make me break
But I'll tell it anyway
This chapter's about
How you said there was nobody else
Then you got up and went to her house
You guys always left me out
I still have the letter you wrote
When you told me that I was the only girl
You'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?
You check in and out
Of my heart like a hotel
And she must be perfect, oh well
I hope you both go to hell
I still have the letter you wrote
When you told me that I was the only girl
You'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are (here we are)
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart? (Heart)
How could you be so reckless?
How could you be so reckless?

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror

I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me

That we're making two reflections into one

Aren't you somethin', an original
'Cause it doesn't seem merely a sample
And I can't help but stare, 'cause

I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (please show me, baby)
I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

You are, you are the love of my life [10x]

Now you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

You are, you are the love of my life [8x]

Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

You are, you are the love of my life [16x]

To keep my heart beating
Don't worry, it's safe right here in my arms
As the world falls apart around us
All we can do is hold on, hold on
Take my hand
And bring me back
I'll risk everything if it's for you
A whisper into the night
Telling me it's not my time and don't give up
I've never stood up before this time

Just gotta keep it
I wanna wake up, wake up
Just tell me how I can
Never give up

Just tell me why baby
They might call me crazy
For saying I'll fight until there is no more
愁いを含んだ閃光 眼光は感覚的衝動
Blinded I can't see the end
So where do I begin
Say not a word I can hear you
The silence between us
なにもないように映ってるだけ
I'll take this chance and I'll make it mine

To give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways
I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want
But I can't deal with all your lovers
You're saying I'm the one
But it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me your love
When you are down and need another
I've gotta get away and let you go
I've gotta get over
But I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know
That I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt
When you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cool and I'm a fool
So please let me go
But I love you so (please let me go)
